                "COVID-19 has struck fear into populations throughout the world and horrified the global medical community, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it a pandemic only 2 and a half months after the outbreak of the disease. Although, as the situation appears to have stabilized in South Korea, other countries throughout the world—including the United States—just started implementing emergency measures. However, the measures, such as slashing interest rates and investing financial resources into the markets, are primarily focused on economic measures, the effects of which are inherently limited in conquering the disease.",
                "This crisis did not result from loans or incompetent financial policies, but from a virus; therefore, macro-economic policies and financial interventions have limitations as responses to this crisis. It is obvious to the medical community that recovery will only be possible when effective medication (s) and a vaccine become available. As an indicator of how preliminary is the nature of our understanding of COVID-19, we are still not able to establish the difference between being symptom-free and experiencing the initial symptoms of the disease. In addition, there is still no formulated system for classifying its typical symptoms as moderate or severe. Leading countries, including South Korea, and large pharmaceutical companies have launched clinical trials to urgently develop medication (s) and a vaccine. We are hoping to see the results of such efforts soon.",
                "With WHO declaring the pandemic, unless COVID-19 dies down worldwide, fear is resonating throughout the world, including erroneous ways such as prejudice against all Asians, including Koreans. Today, as I am writing this, a 17-year-old South Korean adolescent died of aggravated acute respiratory distress syndrome. He tested negative for COVID-19 nine times; although several specimens were drawn (including a urine sample), the final result has not yet been confirmed. Although some reports have stated that the virus can be detected in feces or urine, whether this patient was infected through either of these routes has not yet been confirmed.",
                "Although single-center cohort studies may lead to the formulation of various possible medical and biological explanations regarding the pathology and clinical course of COVID-19, I believe that at this point the most important matter is to develop effective medication (s) and a vaccine by systematically approaching the fundamental problem of the virus itself, which is our responsibility as scientists. Unless validated medication (s) and a vaccine are commercialized in the near future, COVID-19 is likely to become an endemic disease. If this occurs, the fatality rate will depend on the timeliness of diagnoses and the nature of medical treatment that patients in specific regions receive. The ultimate goal is to lower the fatality rate through the dedicated efforts of scientists and medical service providers."

We know that these great efforts are now and will be in the future crucial in overcoming COVID‐19. Providing care to people with diabetes is an important part of the effort. The Journal of Diabetes was started more than a decade ago in a spirit of collaboration between East and West addressing the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, management, complications, and prevention of diabetes. The journal is issuing a call for submission of commentaries, original articles, and case reports regarding issues with COVID‐19 in patients with diabetes, as well as descriptions of basic aspects of the interrelationships between diabetes and the novel CoV. We hope in this way to support the thousands of Chinese medical workers involving themselves in the care of patients with COVID‐19, and we look forward to these efforts helping our goal of eradication of the disease"

                "hina continues to fight the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has infected tens of thousands and killed more than 2,100 people since the end of 2019. The outbreak’s hot spot is in the central province of Hubei, in particular, its capital city Wuhan, where there have been more than 62,000 infections and 2,029 deaths as of last week, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). There, doctors and scientists are desperately struggling to find reliable ways to diagnose infected patients to help treat them and control the spread of the virus. The struggle has involved two diagnostic options—computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs and a nucleic acid lab test—each with advantages and disadvantages. With “a suddenly rampant new virus, it is normal to have multiple test approaches,” says a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"

                "Ondanks gebruik van PBM werd bij 10% tot 100% van de deelnemers in de onderzoeken na gesimuleerde blootstelling toch 'besmetting' met fluorescerende marker geconstateerd. Meer ademende kleding leidde niet tot meer besmetting dan niet-ademende kleding, maar gebruikers waren er wel tevredener over. Jassen leidden tot minder besmetting dan schorten. In vier onderzoeken onderzocht men het effect van PBM-aanpassingen om jassen gemakkelijker uit te kunnen trekken: jassen met handschoenen bevestigd aan de manchet leidden tot minder besmetting dan wanneer men afzonderlijk van elkaar de jas en handschoenen uittrok. Handschoenen en gezichtsmaskers met lipjes voor het verwijderen van de beschermende kleding, leidden tot minder besmetting. Vanwege onder andere methodologische beperkingen en het kleine aantal deelnemers in de onderzoeken is de bewijskracht ten aanzien van soorten beschermende kleding zeer laag. ",
                "In één onderzoek leidde het gebruik van twee paar handschoenen tot minder besmetting dan slechts één paar handschoenen. In een ander onderzoek waarbij twee paar handschoenen werden gebruikt, leidde het gebruik van een desinfecterend middel op alcoholbasis voor het reinigen van de binnenhandschoenen niet tot minder besmetting dan hypochlorietoplossing. In één onderzoek leidde het volgen van CDC-richtlijnen voor het uittrekken van schorten of jassen tot minder besmetting. Eén onderzoek toonde aan dat degenen die gesproken instructies kregen over hoe ze de besmette beschermende kleding op de juiste manier moesten uittrekken, minder besmet waren in vergelijking met degenen die de gesproken instructie niet hadden ontvangen. Eén onderzoek rapporteerde niet genoeg gegevens om conclusies te kunnen trekken. Ook voor de verschillende manieren om beschermende kleding uit te trekken geldt dat de bewijskracht zeer laag is. ",
                "Actieve training, inclusief computersimulatie, leidde tot minder fouten in de keuze van PBM en hoe deze te verwijderen in vergelijking met passieve training.

Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2011;(7):CD006207. Antivirale middelen en vaccinaties zijn mogelijk onvoldoende om verspreiding te voorkomen. Deze Cochrane-review beoordeelt de effectiviteit van fysieke interventies om de verspreiding van respiratoire virussen te onderbreken of te verminderen. Ondanks dat de review niet recent is geüpdatet, is de informatie nog steeds relevant. Moralejo et al. Improving adherence to Standard Precautions for the control of health care-associated infections. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018;2:CD010768. 'Standaardvoorzorgsmaatregelen' is een pakket van acties, zoals het gebruik van persoonlijke beschermingsmiddelen, dat medisch personeel neemt om de verspreiding van ziektekiemen in zorgomgevingen zoals ziekenhuizen en verpleeghuizen te verminderen.

                "De toepasbaarheid van het samengevatte bewijs in de reviews in deze speciale collectie kan beperkt zijn, bijvoorbeeld doordat er verschillen zijn in de aard van de pathogenen en hun wijze van overdracht in vergelijking met wat momenteel bekend is over COVID-19. Lezers moeten er bovendien rekening mee houden dat de reviews in deze speciale collectie het beschikbare bewijsmateriaal over infectiebeheersing- en preventiemaatregelen samenvatten, maar dat dit niet betekent dat is aangetoond dat de onderzochte interventies effectief zijn.",

                "Since December 2019, a series of patients with unknown cause pneumonia had been reported in Wuhan of China. Recently, study on the early transmission dynamics had been reported that human-to-human was the epidemiologic characteristics for COVID-19 infection. 2 Therefore, it is very essential to diagnose precisely the patients suspected with COVID-19 infection for opportune isolation or treatment.",
                "Currently, the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the viral DNA is considered as the \"gold standard\". However, initial RT-PCR is not always positive in the patients with COVID-19 infection. 3, 4 In that situation, chest computed tomographic (CT) images could be played an important role to detect the lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the patients suspected with COVID-19 infection. But it doesn't mean that the abnormalities of CT images could be observed in the COVID-19 infection while the initial RT-PCR is positive or negative. 3-6 Therefore, even though chest CT plays a key role in detection or diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, however, chest CT examination and RT-PCR results should be mutual verification for precise diagnosis in the patient suspected COVID-19 infection.",
                "Clinical characteristics. Beside CT examination results, initial symptoms were helpful in screening. For clinical manifestation, fever, dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, sputum, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. were observed in the patients with COVID-19 infection. 5, 7 Of these clinical characteristics, fever and cough were the most frequency percentage of initial symptoms, and the other manifestations should be taken consideration.",
                "Laboratory results. Laboratory results were considered as auxiliary information to diagnose COVID-19 infection. 5, 7 In our hospital, there were 14 cases confirmed COVID-19 infection. Of 14 patients, white-cell count was tended to be normal in 12 patients (85.71%), lymphocyte (8/14, 57.14%) and monocyte (9/14, 64.29%) percentage had a tendency to decrease. Significant statistical differences were observed in lymphocyte percentage decreased and C-reactive protein elevated (all P = 0.015) in the patients with COVID-19 infection between initial positive chest CT results (10/14) and negative chest CT results (4/14). Thus, knowing these clinical laboratory results was helpful for the doctor to diagnose the current novel coronavirus infection.",
                "Recent studies reported that most of the patients with COVID-19 infection had the exposure history to the source of transmission within past 14 days. Approximately 13 patients (2%) had the history of direct contact with wildlife, 75% cases in the epidemic area or contact with resident of epidemic area. 5, 7 However, 28 cases (35%) with COVID-19 infections were no obvious history of exposure, 5 which needs to pay more attention in this situation.",
                "In conclusion, even though chest CT has played a key role in detection or diagnosis of COVID-19 infection with some typical CT features while the initial RT-PCR result is negative. However, not all the cases had the initial abnormality chest CT results or positive RT-PCR in the patients with COVID-19 infection. Consequently, RT-PCR results, chest CT features, clinical manifestation, laboratory results, and exposure history should be made a comprehensive analysis to diagnose COVID-19 infection for the clinical decisions beyond clinical and radiological features."

Here, we performed proteomic and metabolomic profiling of sera 27 from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals. We then trained a machine 28 learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a 29 training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model correctly 30 classified severe patients with an accuracy of 93.5%, and was further 31 validated using ten independent patients, seven of which were correctly 32 classified. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients 33 implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation and 34 complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This 35 study shows that it is possible to predict progression to severe COVID-19 36 disease using serum protein and metabolite biomarkers. Our data also 37 uncovered molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 with potential for 38 developing anti-viral therapies.",

However, we are not aware of published recommendations for minimising aerosolization and droplet expulsion during extubation.",

Leaving COVID-19 patients intubated after emergency surgery provides the best protection against coughing and aersolisation. Complications of prolonged ventilation and resource constraints during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic make this strategy inappropriate. The following is a summary of our extubation guidelines for COVID-19 patients including description of an extubation technique aimed at minimising staff exposure to SARS-CoV-2.",

The second airway filter is critical to ensuring that disconnecting the circuit on extubation does not allow the anaesthetist to be exposed directly to droplets or aerosols produced by extubation or associated coughing.",

We do not recommend this technique because of the risk of exposure to infective secretions during the additional airway interventions, and manipulation of a supraglottic airway may trigger coughing or laryngospasm. -Position the facemask with second airway filter, using a two-handed technique to ensure a seal over the mouth and nose with the TT exiting under the facemask.",
